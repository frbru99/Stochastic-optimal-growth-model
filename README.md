# Stochastic-optimal-growth-model
This code provides the description and the solution of a simple stochastic optimal growth model.
This code is mostly based on a lecture in QuantEcon website: https://quantecon.org/
The model is a version of the standard one sector, one agent infinite horizon growth model.
It is an extension of the simple cake eating problem
The extension involves:
-nonlinear returns to saving, through a production function,
-stochastic returns, due to shocks to production.
The solution is provided using dynamic programming and value function iteration.
